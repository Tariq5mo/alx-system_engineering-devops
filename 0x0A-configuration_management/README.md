# Configuration management

In this project we learnt about configuration management (CM)
which refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time.

We learnt how to about Puppet and how to use it.
We had three tasks as follows:
0. Create a file by Puppet

1. Install a package by Puppet

2. Execute a command by Puppet
